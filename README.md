# Material clock

Material clock is just a basic HTML, CSS and JS webpage that displays an 'anolog' clock, with an additional weather card. The weather card is using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and your browser's location serivce to provide your geolocation's weather data.

Here's a [Live Demo](https://zealous-almeida-ad2a2f.netlify.app/)!

### It's open source!
